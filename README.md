## VehicleVision.Pleasanter.ItemsAttachmentsDownloader

This tool, developed in C#, simplifies the process of bulk downloading attachments from your Pleasanter instance. It addresses the challenges of accessing attached files, whether they are stored in the database (requiring BASE64 string manipulation) or locally (where filenames are GUIDs and database lookups are necessary).

By allowing downloads at the site level with just the site ID, this tool streamlines the entire process. It is compatible with environments running .NET 10, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and has been tested to work with Pleasanter version 1.4.* and later.

### Features

* **Site-Level Download:** Download all attachments associated with a specific Pleasanter site.
* **Handles Both Storage Types:** Works with attachments stored directly in the database (as BASE64) and those stored locally (with GUID filenames).
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux environments with .NET 10 installed.
* **Pleasanter Compatibility:** Tested with Pleasanter version 1.4.* and later.
* **Command-Line Interface:** Operated through simple command-line arguments.
* **Organized Output:** Downloads are structured in a directory format for easy management.
* **Optional Target Fields:** Allows you to specify which attachment fields to include in the download.

### Usage

The tool is executed via the command line. Ensure that .NET 10 is installed on your system.

dotnet VehicleVision.Pleasanter.ItemsAttachmentsDownloader.dll /Url:{PLEASANTER_URL} /SiteId:{SITE_ID} /ApiKey:{API_KEY} /Path:{OUTPUT_PATH} [/Target:{TARGET_FIELDS}] [/Skip:{SKIP_FIELDS}]
